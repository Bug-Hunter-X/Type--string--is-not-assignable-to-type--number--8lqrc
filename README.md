This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string value is assigned to a variable or parameter that is expected to be a number.  The error message typically appears as: "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'".

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides the corrected version with explanations.

This is a simple example of a common issue that can be encountered when working with type safety in TypeScript.  Understanding how types work is fundamental for building robust and reliable applications.
